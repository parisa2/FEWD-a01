# Hi there! I'm Parisa.
   I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in electrical engineering (EE) based on my talent in mathematics. Although continuing my studies in EE could be significantly facilitated by the abundance of scholarships in engineering, I decided to change my major to  design for which I have always had the greatest passion and enthusiasm. 
   
   This, however, came at the frustrating cost of spending the initial time at home due to the unaffordably high college/university tuitions. Then, I unbelievably heard about the free classes in * San diego Continiuing Education * related to design. This was a moment of hope in my life that has continued thereafter throughout the programs that I have had in this community.I had Interactive Media Certificate Program (IMCP) at SDCE fall 2016 and now I have has Front End Web Development (FEWDI&II).

   * playing vollyball
