# Hi there! I'm Parisa.
   I came to US four years ago due to my husband scholarship from UCSD. From that time I'm trying to improve my English and some other skills related to design which I have always had the greatest passion and enthusiasm. 
   
   This, however, came at the frustrating cost of spending the initial time in a new country with a new language to find a way to start this path due to the unaffordably high college/university tuitions. Then, I unbelievably heard about the free classes in * San diego Continiuing Education * . This was a moment of hope in my life that has continued thereafter throughout the programs that I have had in this community.I had ESL6 at Mesa college SDCE in 2015-2016, Interactive Media Certificate Program (IMCP) in  2016-2017 and now I have has Front End Web Development (FEWDI&II) in 2017-2018.
