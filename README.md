# FEWD-a01

# Hi there! I'm Parisa.
   I came to US four years ago due to my husband Fellowship Program from UCSD. Since then,  I have been working on English and some other skills related to design which I have always had the greatest passion and enthusiasm. 
   
   This, however, came at the frustrating cost of spending the initial time in a new country with a new language to find a way to start this path due to the unaffordably high college/university tuitions. Then, I heard about the free classes in * San diego Continiuing Education * . This was a moment of hope in my life that has continued thereafter throughout the programs that I have had in this community.I had ESL6 at Mesa college SDCE in 2015-2016, Interactive Media Certificate Program (IMCP) in  2016-2017 and now I have has Front End Web Development (FEWDI&II) in 2017-2018. 
   
   Thus far, taking IMCP has enabled me to create a rich skill portfolio that will assist me in taking future steps stronger. Indeed, two of my designs from IMCP won the first place in the San Deigo County Fair 2017. Besides, in a group project in FEWD I, we designed and coded a website for the San Diego non-profit organization Woman Resource Center (WRC), supporting women involved in or threatened by domestic violence or sexual assault. Currently, we are contacting WRC to offer them using this website in place of the older one.
   
   Finally, I want to find a way to continue into higher education both to achieve financial independence and change the world around me to make it a better place to live for everyone.
